Section 1: Introduction to Testing
This document serves as a test file for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. The purpose is to verify that documents can be uploaded, indexed, and searched within the knowledge base.

Section 2: Technical Details
The RAG system uses embeddings to create vector representations of text chunks. These vectors enable semantic search capabilities, allowing the system to find relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

Section 3: Features and Capabilities
- Document upload and storage
- Text chunking and embedding generation
- Semantic search functionality
- Integration with language models
- Real-time indexing and retrieval

Section 4: Use Cases
The knowledge base can be used for various applications including:
1. Customer support documentation
2. Technical manuals and guides
3. Research papers and articles
4. Company policies and procedures
5. Educational materials

Section 5: Conclusion
This test document demonstrates the basic functionality of the RAG system. By uploading and indexing this content, we can verify that the system is working correctly and ready for production use.
